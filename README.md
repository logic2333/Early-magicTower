早期作品-魔塔游戏

'Early' means before my graduate period, when my major was not CS-related. These codes show little concept of 'software engineering', or say 'architecture', though some of them can be called 'project'.

“早期”指的是在我的研究生阶段之前（我本科所学专业与信息类完全无关）。这些代码很少有“软件工程”的概念，或者说很少有“架构设计”，尽管其中有几个的规模使得它们还是足以能被称为“工程项目”。

These codes are too troublesome to review, so i put them here merely for recording. To see my progress.

这些代码要review起来着实费劲，所以我把它们放在这里仅仅是为了记录。嗯，记录自己的成长历程哈哈哈。

This one is large enough to be called a 'toy project'. Game designing, UI designing and coding are all done by myself. Pitifully i didn't finish it. It is designed to have 19(0-18) floors, but i have only finished 11(0-10). On floor 10 is designed to be a small boss; but literally it becomes the final one. i have finished designing floor 11-18 on paper, but feel bored to put them into practice. It is coded with Pygame module.

这一个足以被称作一个“娱乐型工程项目”。从游戏策划、界面设计到编码都是我一人进行的。很遗憾没能做完它。本来设计了19（0-18）层，但程序只完成到了第10层。第10层是个小boss，这下变成了事实上的大boss。11-18层仅在纸上完成了设计，写这种繁杂的业务还是让我感到了无聊，就没兴趣做完它了。用了Pygame模块。
